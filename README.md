# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
``` PYTHON
/*
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by:SASI RAJ KUMAR T J
#RegisterNumber:22005240
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
prod=a**b
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",prod) 
*/
```

## INPUT
![exponentiation of a number](expo.PNG)
## OUTPUT
![OUTPUT](outcome.png)



## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
